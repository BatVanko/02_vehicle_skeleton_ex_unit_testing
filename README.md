# 02_vehicle_skeleton_ex_unit_testing
In this exercise everyone should use the source code (skeleton) written for each of the four problems ( 02. Vehicle) from the Testing exercise. You have the structure and functionality of the classes, and now you should test them. You are NOT ALLOWED to change the class. Cover the whole class with unit tests to make sure that the class is working as intended.
